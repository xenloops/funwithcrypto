# True Random Number Generator algorithms

## *F. catus* algorithm
1. Locate common housecat. If safety is of no concern, a ferile one will do nicely.
2. Place housecat on desk where you've been working diligently on some problem. 
It helps if you've recently spilled food or drink on the surface and haven't had time for a thorough cleaning.
3. If additional random material is needed, repeat process.

## Alternate *F. catus* algorithm
Many domesticated cats follow this handy method naturally.
1. Work diligently on some problem for many hours, preferably past normal feeding time.
2. Common housecat will locate you.
3. Cat will jump on desk where you've been working, rub against your hands on the keyboard and waving tail in your face.
4. Cat will walk across keyboard.
3. If additional random material is needed, push cat gently away so it can repeat process.
