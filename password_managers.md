# OMG! The password manager site I've depended on was breached!

Don't you hate when that happens? If you're concerned about any passwords you've stored somewhere being leaked ([ahem](https://www.pcmag.com/news/lastpass-suffers-another-breach-and-this-time-customer-data-is-affected)), do the following now:

1. Change the passwords for any site you care about: banking, health insurance, social media. See below about choosing good passwords.
1. Find another password manager.

## Choosing great passwords

We should be familiar with the best practices surrounding passwords:

* Make them long (all of mine are at least 25 characters, except for the boneheaded sites that have a shorter length limit).
* Make them complex (include letters, numbers, and choose from _all_ symbols allowed for the site).
* Make them random -- and not the weeny pseudo-random that your laptop uses. Use a site like [Random.org's password generator](https://www.random.org/passwords/?mode=advanced), which uses atmospheric chaos to generate random things (though you'll need to add special characters -- randomly of course).
* 

## What password manager can I trust?

Now that is becoming a personal question. 

### Encryption

The currently NIST-approved algorithm AES (originally called Rijndael) is widely used which is great, since the more an algorithm is exercised, the more it gets tested and the more likely problems will surface. Some more conspiracy-minded security folks won't trust it due to suspicions of NIST working a bit too closely with some government TLAs[^1]. Most of us not running crime syndicates shouldn't worry about such things, though if the NSA did indeed insert backdoors into AES, that does by definition weaken the algorithm for all.
